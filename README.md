# USDT_INR_Market_Making_Backtest

## Introduction
This project implements and backtests a market-making trading strategy for cryptocurrency pairs like USDT/INR. The strategy involves placing buy and sell orders around the market price, taking advantage of small price fluctuations for profit. We simulate the strategy using historical data and track the capital, profit/loss, and trades executed over time.
